While the Fringe is something Britain should be proud of, we must also recognise that a disproportionate number of the performers (and even the audience) will be white, middle class and wealthy. Although Britain’s creative industry is more inclusive than many parts of mainland Europe, there is still unmet potential."

This gap is being filled by grassroots producers and media outlets, but with a lack of access to opportunities, venues and funding, they are up against a well-oiled machine that has been conceived by and maintained for decades by Britain’s elite."

It was established in 1947 at a time when post-war Britain was unapologetically monocultural in its arts and media - and little has changed in the 72 years since. Last year, mixed-race actor Layton Williams received an official apology after he was kicked out of a venue in a case of racial profiling, and other performers of colour regularly describe feeling lonely and vulnerable amongst the overwhelmingly white audience and performers."

Change is needed at the top; from major broadcasters like the BBC to the organisers behind the Edinburgh Fringe. They needn't look far with grassroots outlets like British Muslim TV regularly platforming emerging talent and giving a voice to content creators that would otherwise be overlooked by the mainstream.

I was a part of it. We were angry, we wanted a future where we could fulfil our potential. Our struggle was a struggle for voice as we did not see our views and hopes represented within our own governments. Even if the outcome and the progress of the protests vary from one country to another, there can be no doubt that the youth has changed the course of history."

Their involvement went beyond direct participation in the protests. Be it as organizers, journalists or political activists - young women became the leading force in cyber-activism. Before I became a youth envoy of the African Union - I was one of these women. We seized the momentum to make our voices heard and our actions seen."

"The G7 should deliver progress, not promises, on gender equality ǀ View","https://www.euronews.com/2019/08/26/the-g7-should-deliver-progress-not-promises-on-gender-equality-view","Every participating country at the G7 summit should commit to implementing at least two legislative or policy changes on gender equality by 2022 - either by abolishing discriminatory laws or by putting in place progressive ones. This could for instance include for Senegal criminalizing rape or ensuring national policies such as on education are gender responsive. Equal pay for equal work is another example."

They should ensure that the vast majority of their development aid contributes to gender equality and that at least 20 percent of their aid promotes this as a primary purpose. But also the African governments need to do their homework and invest their domestic resources in unleashing the potential of girls and women within their countries."

Historically, international cooperation, joint decisions and initiating global processes were what enhanced the legitimacy of the G7. Let’s hope we see progress not promises for women’s rights. We are not waiting 108 more years to receive what should be ours already."
