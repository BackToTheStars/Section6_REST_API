# Summary

UPDATE: Print in ABS since PLA will tend to warp and sag down beacause of the heat coming up from the hot bed.

So, I found that the other double mounts didn't fit my machine because it seems that the hexagon hot end was raised 1-2 mm in my particular Robo 3D R1 model (purchased August 2015). The other designs were scrapping the build platform.

Specifically I tried this ones:

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1026691

I kept the same double mount and modelled the shrouds again.
However several modifications were made to accommodate the extra mm that were needed to clear the build platform and still point the air nozzles in the right direction. The inner surfaces were given a nice curved contour so air flows smoothly to the nozzle end. It sits nicely 3 mm above the build platform now!

I used 2 coarse threaded 1/8" phillips screws to mount each fan shroud onto the double mount and 4 coarse threaded 1/8" allen screws to secure each fan to its respective shroud. Screw them directly, no need to tap and thread the holes.

I'm also making available a STEP file and a Rhinoceros 3D file so you guys can make adjustments and modifications should you need to.
